# BikeShareGoogleAnalytics
Capstone project for Google Data Analytics Course
ASK
In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are geotracked and locked into a network of 692 stations across Chicago. The bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system anytime. Until now, Cyclistic’s marketing strategy relied on building general awareness and appealing to broad consumer segments. One approach that helped make these things possible was the flexibility of its pricing plans: single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships. Customers who purchase single-ride or full-day passes are referred to as casual riders. Customers who purchase annual memberships are Cyclistic members. Cyclistic’s finance analysts have concluded that annual members are much more profitable than casual riders. Although the pricing flexibility helps Cyclistic attract more customers, Moreno believes that maximizing the number of annual members will be key to future growth. Rather than creating a marketing campaign that targets all-new customers, Moreno believes there is a very good chance to convert casual riders into members. She notes that casual riders are already aware of the Cyclistic program and have chosen Cyclistic for their mobility needs.

Business Task
Three questions have been asked by the business and they are:

1.How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
2.Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
3.How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?
As the Data Analyst I have tasked with providing answers on the first question: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclisric bikes differently?
